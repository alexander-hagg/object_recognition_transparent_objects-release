Transparent objects
===================
This module enables recognition and pose estimation of transparent objects. For details of the algorithm see the paper "Recognition and Pose Estimation of Rigid Transparent Objects with a Kinect Sensor" by Ilya Lysenkov, Victor Eruhimov and Gary Bradski, RSS 2012.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The module is a part of the Recognition Kitchen so all you need to do is to install the Kitchen. See http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/ for installation instructions.

Using
^^^^^
For a sample how to use the algorithm see the ``sample/sample.cpp`` file. This sample is compiled into the ``bin`` directory. You can run it by passing the path to the ``sample`` directory as the command line parameter, for example:

::

  ./bin/sample ../or-transparent-objects/sample/
